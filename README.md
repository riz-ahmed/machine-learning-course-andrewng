# Machine Learning algorithms

All algorithms are developed using Octave 5.2.0 for prototyping learning algorithms while learning. 

## Pre-built algorithms

* Plotting decision boundary (straight-line) after fminunc determines the most optimal parameters (theta) for the given cost funciton and gradient's
* Feature mapping, creating a column vector of hiher ordrer polynomials using two features
