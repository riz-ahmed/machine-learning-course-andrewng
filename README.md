# Machine Learning algorithms

All algorithms are developed using Octave 5.2.0 for prototyping learning algorithms while learning.

## Pre-built algorithms

* Plotting decision boundary (straight-line) after fminunc determines the most optimal parameters (theta) for the given cost funciton and gradient's
* Feature mapping, creating a column vector of hiher ordrer polynomials using two features

## Note

* The detailed explaination of writing the gradient descent algorithms both for regularized and un-regularized forms are given in file _*ex3.pdf*_
* To distrubute a variable between two limits, such that the variable lies between these two limits, use this relation theta = rand(5,3) * (2 * epsilon) - epsilon. Here theta is distrubuted between -epsilon to +epsilon
